# Oustanding User Interfaces with Shiny

## TO DO

  - add exercices and assignements for each chapter
  - rework skeleton chapter to use more htmltools functions
  - find a way to make the code standalone (side pkg): I currently include JavaScript with `tags$script()` which is quite bad practice but easier to focus on writing the book first. 
  - add chapter to test shiny tags, JavaScript input bindings, ...
