# Oustanding User Interfaces with Shiny

## TO DO

  - add exercices and assignements for each chapter
  - [x] rework skeleton chapter to use more htmltools functions
  - [x] find a way to make the code standalone (side pkg): I currently include JavaScript with `tags$script()` which is quite bad practice but easier to focus on writing the book first. 
  - include apps as iframes for demo
  - [x] add chapter to test shiny tags, Jav1aScript input bindings, ...
  - [x] finish Shiny chapter -> add more screenshots to message handler
  - [x] finish more interactivity chapter
  - [x] split Chapter 4: this chapter could be a entire section
  - [x] add a part on tabs validation in testing/validating chapter
  - more references!
  - add chapter on how to develop a package for user interfaces.
  - add chapter listing all available templates
  - local pkg setup for each Rmd file?
