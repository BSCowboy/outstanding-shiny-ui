# Oustanding User Interfaces with Shiny

## TO DO

  - add exercices and assignements for each chapter
  - [x] rework skeleton chapter to use more htmltools functions
  - find a way to make the code standalone (side pkg): I currently include JavaScript with `tags$script()` which is quite bad practice but easier to focus on writing the book first. 
  - include apps as iframes for demo
  - [x] add chapter to test shiny tags, JavaScript input bindings, ...
  - [x] finish Shiny chapter -> add more screenshots to message handler
  - finish more interactivity chapter
  - [x] split Chapter 4: this chapter could be a entire section
  - add a part on tabs validation in testing/validating chapter
