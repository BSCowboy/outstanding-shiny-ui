# Introduction {#intro}

There are various Shiny focused resources introducing basic as well as advanced topics such as modules and Javascript/R interactions. However, handling advanced user interfaces was never an emphasis. Clients often desire custom designs, yet this generally exceeds core features of Shiny. We recognized that R App developers lacking a significant background in web development may have found this requirement to be overwhelming. Consequently, the aim of this book is to provide readers the necessary knowledge to extend Shiny's layout, input widgets and output elements. This book is organized into four parts. We first go through the basics of HTML, JavaScript and jQuery. In part 2, we dive into the {htmltools} package, providing functions to create and manipulate shiny tags as well as manage dependencies. Part 3 homes in on the development of a new template on top of Shiny by demonstrating examples from the {bs4Dash} and {shinyMobile} packages, part of the RinteRface project.
