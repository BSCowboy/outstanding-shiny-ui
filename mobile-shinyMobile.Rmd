# Reconstruct `{shinyMobile}` {#mobile-shinyMobile}

## Introduction to Framework7
Framework7 is the HTML/CSS/JavaScript engine that fuels `{shinyMobile}`. 
It is a flexible toolkit to build native looking web apps or progressive
web apps (PWA). It has a incredibly rich ecosystem:

  - Provides a core JavaScript API, React API, Vue API, Svelte API.
  - A CLI to ease the creation of PWA, provide boilerplate and started templates.
  - A full set of native [icons](https://framework7.io/icons/).
  - Hundreds of components with different look for iOS and material design, even desktop. 
  - A comprehensive set of [documentation](https://framework7.io/docs/). 
  - A supportive [community](https://forum.framework7.io/). 

## Initiate the package
This is time to initialize the package structure and extract the Framework7 dependencies.
To get an idea of the package file structure, we run:

```{r}
library(charpente)
get_dependency_assets("framework7")
```

We browse to the [package](https://framework7.io/docs/package.html) structure page,
which provides details about necessary components. We are going to use the bundle version since
the lite approach is missing several components. We therefore only need `framework7.bundle.min.js` and
`framework7.bundle.min.css`, which is the default options of `create_dependency`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
path <- file.path(tempdir(), "shinyMobile")
create_charpente(path, license = "mit")
```

Once the package created and opened, we download Framework7 dependencies:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
create_dependency("framework7")
```

which generates the `framework7-dependencies.R` script:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
add_framework7_deps <- function(tag) {
 framework7_deps <- htmltools::htmlDependency(
  name = "framework7",
  version = "5.7.14",
  src = c(file = "framework7-5.7.14"),
  script = "js/framework7.bundle.min.js",
  stylesheet = "css/framework7.bundle.min.css",
  package = "shinyMobile",
 )
 htmltools::tagList(tag, framework7_deps)
}
```


## Framework7 Layouts
Framework7 has 3 predefined layouts (Figure \@ref(fig:mobile-framework7-layouts)):

  - Single page layout.
  - Multi tabs layout.
  - Split layout: this template is focused for tablet/desktop use. 
  It is composed of a sidebar and a main panel.
  
```{r mobile-framework7-layouts, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Framework7 layouts', out.width='33%', fig.align = "default", fig.show = "hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mobile/mobile-shinymobile-single-layout.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/mobile/mobile-shinymobile-tabs-layout.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/mobile/mobile-shinymobile-split-layout.png")
```
