# R + Shiny + React: welcome `{reactR}` {#going-further-reactR}
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is an open source library designed to quickly develop user interfaces or UI components, on the front end. 
It has been developed by [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook/react) and the community (more than 1500 contributors) 
and made public in May 29 2013. It is currently used worldwide and has around 163k stars on the
Github ranking and widely impacts the mobile market, through the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) library.  
React is also really convenient to develop attractive documentations with [docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).
If you ever have built user interfaces with pure JS, you might like React! 

Below, we give a short introduction to the React ecosystem and see how we can benefit from it from the
R Shiny side. 

## Quick introduction to React
To understand React there are few prerequisites notably basic HTML/CSS/JS knowledge, especially JS modules (see 
section \@ref(about-js-modules)). However, if you managed to reach this chapter, you should not worry too much. 

### Setup
`Node` and `npm` are required. If you are not sure, run:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```

At that stage it is also good to have [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) as we'll need it for `{reactR}`.

If nothing is returned, please refer to section \@ref(install-node). To initiate a React [project](https://create-react-app.dev/),
we leverage the `npx` command:

```
npx create-react-app <PROJECT_NAME>
```

Replace `<PROJECT_NAME>` by the real name of your project. If this seems intimidating, 
keep in mind this is the same concept has using the `{golem}` [package](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) 
to initiate the creation of robust shiny projects, except that we work from the terminal.

Once done (the package initialization takes some time), 
move to the project folder and launch the demo app:

```
cd <PROJECT_NAME> && npm start
```

If you have yarn, `yarn start` also works.

You should see something similar to Figure \@ref(fig:basic-react-app).

```{r basic-react-app, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='npm start opens the react app', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/going-further/basic-react-app.png")
```

### Basics
We are now all set up to start learning the basics of React. Among all created files,
notice the `/src/app.js` file. Inside the `App` function, we remove all the content inside
the `return` statement to put a simple `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>` HTML title. We also clean the imports
as we don't need any CSS and logo anymore. We obtain:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  );
}

export default App; // don't remove, this is needed by index.js
```

Once done, we run `npm build` (or `yarn build`), to rebuild the JS code and `npm start` to
restart the server and preview the app. In practice, once the server is launched, there is 
no need to restart it whenever the code is updated. A simple save will refresh the interface!

The code you see above is a React component. The definition is rather simple: it is a function that returns
a moreless complex piece of UI. How are components rendered by React?

So far, we didn't have a look at the `/src/index.js` script. Inside we find:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  App,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

__Note__: recent version of `npx create-react-app` have `<React.StrictMode><App /></React.StrictMode>` instead
 of `App`, which does the same thing. You may also find `<App />`. In practice, we rarely modify this part.

In short, this inserts the `App` component inside the element having `root` as id in the main
HTML page. This HTML skeleton may be found in the `public/index.html` folder. You may guess that at the end
of the day, our app will be composed of multiple bricks and called `ReactDOM.render` on the top level component.

#### About JSX
We just wrote our first React component. Didn't you notice something weird in that code? 
JS and HTML are mixed, in what we called JSX, that is a syntax extension to JS. JSX makes the code
less verbose, for instance:

```js
React.createElement(
  'h1',
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

does exactly the same thing as above but when the code becomes more complex, it is nearly
impossible to read. 

Let's see how to pass variables into JSX. We want to show `Hello, <Your Name>`, we store
the name in a variable and modify the `app.js` code accordingly:

```jsx
function App() {
  const name = "David";
  return (
    <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
  );
}
```

Expressions are passed within curly brackets `{expression}` and you may even call functions inside.

Tag attributes also require curly brackets. Let's modify the title tag to give it a color and 
a size.

```jsx
function App() {
  const name = "David";
  return (
    <h1 style={color: "red", fontSize: 40}>Hello, {name}</h1>
  );
}
```

Try to save. Why does this fail? We can't pass multiple object properties inside a single `{}`.
We need either double brackets like `{{object properties: values, ...}}` or to store the object in 
a variable before:

```jsx
function App() {
  const name = "David";
  return (
    <h1 style={{color: "red", fontSize: 40}}>Hello, {name}</h1>
  );
}

// OR

function App() {
  const name = "David";
  const myStyle = {
    color: "red", 
    fontSize: 40
  }
  return (
    <h1 style={myStyle}>Hello, {name}</h1>
  );
}
```

Notice that we write CSS properties following the camelCase syntax, `font-size` being equivalent to `fontSize`.

#### Combining components
The whole interest is to combine multiple components to create reusable pieces. We edit the above code 
to create a `SayHello` component. Notice the `props` parameter. It is a way to pass configuration from the 
parent component. In that case, we want to display the person name, that is `props.name`. In the meantime,
we edit the `App` parent component and call `SayHello` three times, passing a different name like `<SayHello name="David" />` (this is the reason why we recover `props.name` in the lower level component):

```jsx
function SayHello(props) {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
  );
}


function App() {
  return(
  <>
    <SayHello name="David" />
    <SayHello name="Lisa" />
    <SayHello name="Simon" />
  </>
  );
}
```

Notice the enclosing `<>...</>`. This is called a React fragment and useful if we don't want to
insert any extra `<div>` in the DOM. 

We could be even more efficient by leveraging the lists capabilities. We create an array
of names and apply the `map` method to return the corresponding `<SayHello />` sub-component:

```jsx
const names = ["David", "Lisa", "Simon"];
function App() {
  const sayHelloToAll = names.map((name) => <SayHello key={name} name={name} />); 
  return(sayHelloToAll);
}
```

By convention, all elements inside a `map` require keys. 

Props are __read-only__ and must not be modified withing their own component. 
How do we update components?

## Introduction to `{reactR}`

### Scaffold inputs

### Toward custom components
Creating custom components in Shiny is not that easy. If we assume we want to create
a custom text container which color, size and many CSS properties can change dynamically. 
This is a bit different from the approach shown in Chapter \@ref(beautify-with-bootstraplib) since
the `{bslib}` gives access to Bootstrap [variables](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bs4-variables.html) but not
basic CSS properties like the color of a `span` element.
