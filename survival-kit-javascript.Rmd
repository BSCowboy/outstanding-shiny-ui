# JavaScript {#survival-kit-javascript}

## Introduction 
JavaScript (JS) was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich and also known as ECMAScript (ES). Interestingly, you might have heard about ActionScript, which is no more than an implementation of ES by Adobe Systems. Nowadays, JavaScript is a centerpiece of the web and included in almost all websites. 

Let's make a little experiment. If you have a personal blog (it is very popular in the RStats community) you probably know Hugo or Jekyll. These tools allow to quickly setup professionnal looking (or at least not too ugly) blogs in literraly few minutes. You can focus on the content and this is what matters! Now, if you open the HTML inspector introduced in Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-html), click on the elements tab (in theory it is the first tab and open by default), and uncollapse the `<head>` tag, you see that a lot of scripts are included, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:scripts-list). Same remark in the `<body>` tag.

```{r scripts-list, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A website is full of JavaScript'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/scripts-list.png")
```

There are 2 ways to include scripts:

  - Use the `<script>` tag with the JS code inside
  - Import an external file containing the JS code and only
  
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
// JS code here
</script>
```

```html
<!-- We use the src attribute to link the external file -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="file.js">
```

Whether to choose the first or second method depends on the content of your script. If we consider jQuery, a well known JS library, it contains so much lines of code that it does not make sense to select the first method. 


## Programming with JS: basis
Below we quickly introduce fundamental features of JS. JS is made of variables and instructions.
