# JavaScript {#survival-kit-javascript}

## Introduction 
JavaScript (JS) was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich and also known as ECMAScript (ES). Interestingly, you might have heard about ActionScript, which is no more than an implementation of ES by Adobe Systems. Nowadays, JavaScript is a centerpiece of the web and included in almost all websites. 

Let's make a little experiment. If you have a personal blog (it is very popular in the RStats community) you probably know Hugo or Jekyll. These tools allow to quickly setup professionnal looking (or at least not too ugly) blogs in literraly few minutes. You can focus on the content and this is what matters! Now, if you open the HTML inspector introduced in Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-html), click on the elements tab (in theory it is the first tab and open by default), and uncollapse the `<head>` tag, you see that a lot of scripts are included, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:scripts-list). Same remark in the `<body>` tag.

```{r scripts-list, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A website is full of JavaScript'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/scripts-list.png")
```

There are 2 ways to include scripts:

  - Use the `<script>` tag with the JS code inside
  - Import an external file containing the JS code and only
  
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
// JS code here
</script>
```

```html
<!-- We use the src attribute to link the external file -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="file.js">
```

Whether to choose the first or second method depends on the content of your script. If we consider jQuery, a well known JS library, it contains so much lines of code that it does not make sense to select the first method. 

## Setup
Like R or Python, JavaScript is an interpreted language. It is also executed client side, that is in the navigator. It also means that you cannot run js code without suitable tools. 

### Node
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) contains an interpreter for JS as well as a dependencies manager, npm (Node Package Manager). To install Node on your computer, browse to the website and follow the intruction. Once done, open a terminal and check if

```
$ which node
$ node --version
```
returns something. If not, it means that Node is not properly installed. 

### Choose a good IDE
I really like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) for all the JS things since it contains a Node interpreter and you can seamlessly execute any JS code (the truth is because I'm a big fan of the dracula color theme). But the [Rstudio IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) may also be fine, provided that you have Node installed. Below, we will see how to run a JS code in both IDE.

### First Script
Let's write our first script:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

You notice that all instruction end by `;`. You can run this script either in Rstudio IDE or VSCode. 

```{r script-vscode, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Run JS in VSCode'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/script-vscode.png")
```

In VSCode, clicking on the run arrow (top center) of Figure \@ref(fig:script-vscode),
triggers the `node hello.js` command, which tells Node to run my script. We see the result in the right panel (code=0 means the execution is fine and we even have the compute time). To run this script in the RStudio IDE, you need to click on the terminal tab (you could also open a basic terminal) and type `node hello.js` (or `node mycustompath/hello.js` if you are not in the folder containing the script). You should see the Hello World message in the console (see Figure \@ref(fig:script-rstudio)).

```{r script-rstudio, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Run JS in a terminal'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/script-rstudio.png")
```

## Programming with JS: basis
We are now all set to introduce the basis of JS. As many languages, JS is made of variables and instructions (We saw above that instructions end by `;`).

### JS types
JS defines several types:

  - Number: does not distinguish between integers and others (in R for instance, numeric contains integers and double)
  - String: characters ('blabla')
  - Boolean: true/false
  
To check the type of an element, we may use the `typeof` operator (this is not a function like the `typeof` function in R).

```javascript
typeof 1; // number
typeof 'pouic'; // string
```

### Variables
A variable is defined by:

  - a type
  - a name
  - a value

<br>
<div class="callout callout-danger">
Valid variable names: 
<ul>
<li>don't use an existing name like typeof</li>
<li>son't start with a number (123)</li>
<li>don't include any space (total price)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>

Based on the above forbidden items, you can use the camelCase syntax to write your variables in JS. To set a variable we use `let` (there exists `var` but this is not the latest JS norm (ES6). You will see later that we still use `var` in the shiny core and many other R packages):

```javascript
let myVariable = 'welcome';
console.log(myVariable);
```

Then we can use all mathematical operators to manipulate a variable.

```javascript
let myNumber = 1; // affectation
myNumber--; // decrement
console.log(myNumber); // print 0
```

<br>
<div class="callout callout-info">
List of numerical operators in JS: 
<ul>
<li>+</li>
<li>-</li>
<li>*</li>
<li>/</li>
<li>% (modulo)</li>
<li>++ (incrementation)</li>
<li>-- (decrementation)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>

To concatenate 2 strings, use `+`.

### Conditions
Below are the operators to check conditions.

<br>
<div class="callout callout-info">
<ul>
<li>== (A equal B)</li>
<li>!= (A not equal to B)</li>
<li>> (>=)</li>
<li>< (<=)</li>
<li>AND (A AND B)</li>
<li>OR (A OR B)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>

To test conditions there exists several ways:

  - `if (condition) { console.log('Test passed'); }`
  - `if (condition) { instruction A} else { instruction B }`
  
This is very common to other languages (and R for instance). Whenever a lot of possible conditions need to be evaluated, it is better to choose the `switch`.


```javascript
switch (variable) {
  case val1: // instruction 1
  break; // don't forget the break!
  case val2:  // instruction 2
  break;
  default: // when none of val1 and val2 are satisfied
}
```

### Iterations
Iterations allow to repeat an instruction or a set of instructions multiple times. 

#### For loops
The for loop has multiple ways to be used. Below is the most classic. We start by defining the index (variable). We then set an upper bound and we finish by incrementing the index value. We execute the instruction between curly braces.

```javascript
const max = 10; // we never mentionned constants before. This is the way to call them
for (let i = 0; i <= max; i++) {
  console.log(i); // this will print i 10 times
}
```

<br>
<div class="callout callout-danger">
Contrary to R, JavaScript index starts from 0 (not from 1)! This is good to keep in mind when we will mix both R and JS.
</div>
<br>

Below is another way to create a for loop:

```javascript
let samples = ['blabla', 1, null]; // this is an array!
for (let sample of samples) {
 console.log(sample);
}
```

What is the best `for` loop? The answer is: it depends on the situation! Actually, there even exists other ways (replace of by in and you get the indexes of the array, like the with the first code, but this is really [not recommended](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/04/es6-in-depth-iterators-and-the-for-of-loop/)).


#### Other iterations: while, do while
We will clearly never use them in this book but this is good to know. 

```javascript
const h = 3; i = 0;
while (i <= h) {
  console.log(i);
  i++; // we need to increment to avoid infinite loop
}
```


### Objects
JavaScript is an object oriented programming language (like Python). An object is defined by:

  - a type
  - some properties
  - some methods (to manipulate properties)
  
Let's define our first object below:

```javascript
const me = {
  name : 'Divad',
  age : 29,
  music : '',
  printName: function() {
    console.log(`I am ${this.name}`);
  }
}

console.log(JSON.stringify(me)); // print a human readable object.
  
console.log(me.name);
console.log(me.age);
console.log(me.music);
// don't repeat yourself!!!
for (let key in me) { // here is it ok to use `in`
 console.log(`me[${key}] is ${me[key]}`);
}

me.printName();
```

Some comments on the above code:

  - to access an object propertie, we use `object.propertie`
  - to print a human readable version of the object `JSON.stringify` will do the job
  - we introduced string interpolation with `${*}`. `*` may be any valid expression.
  - methods are accessed like properties (we may also pass parameters). We use `this` to refer to the object itself. Take note, we will see it a lot!
  
In JavaScript, we can find already predefined objects to interact with arrays, dates.


### Functions
Functions are useful to wrap a succession of instructions to accomplish a given task. Defining functions allows programmers to save time (less copy and paste, less search and replace), do less errors and share code more easily. In modern JavaScript (ES6), functions are defined as follows:

```javascript
const a = 1;
const fun = (parm1, parm2) => {
  console.log(a);
  let p = 3;
  return Math.max(parm1, parm2); // I use the Math object that contains the max method
}
let res = fun(1, 2);
console.log(res); // prints a and 2. a global
console.log(p); // fails because p was defined inside the function
```

This functions computes the maximum of 2 provided numbers. Some comments about scoping rules: variables defined inside the function are available for the function but not outside. The function may use global variables defined outside of it.

#### Export functions: about modules
What happens if you wrote 100 functions and you would like to reuse some of them in different scripts? To prevent copy and pasting, we will introduce modules. Let's save the below function in a script `utils.js`:

```javascript
const findMax = (parm1, parm2) => {
  return Math.max(parm1, parm2); // I use the Math object that contains the max method
}

module.exports = {
  findMax = findMax
}
```

Now, if we create a `test.js` script in the same folder and want to use `findMax`, we need to import the corresponding module:

```javascript
const {findMax} = require('./utils.js');
findMax(1, 2); // prints 2
```

## jQuery

### Introduction
[jQuery](https://jquery.com) is a famous JavaScript library providing a user friendly interface to manipulate the DOM and is present in almost all actual websites. It is slighly easier (understand more convenient to use) than vanilla JS, even though web developers tend to avoid it to go back to vanilla JS (Bootstrap 5, the next iteration of Bootstrap will not rely on jQuery anymore). To use jQuery in a webpage, we must include its code either by dowloading the code and putting the minified JS file in our HTML or setting a link to a CDN. 

### Syntax
Below is a minimal jQuery code representing its philosophy ("write less, do more."):

```javascript
$(selector).action();
```
The selector slot stands for any jQuery selector like class, id, element, [attribute], :input (will select all input elements) and many [more](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp). As a reminder, let's consider the following example:

```html
<p class="text">Hello World</p>
```

To select and interact with this element, we use JavaScript and jQuery:

```javascript
let inner = document.getElementsByClassName('text').innerHTML; // vanilla JS
let inner = $('.text').html(); // jQuery
```

jQuery is obviously simpler than pure JavaScript. 

### Useful functions

TO DO: add more examples of useful function we (may) use later

## Event listeners

TO TO: this will be needed in the following part

In the next chapters, we will see that some of the underlying JS code to build custom shiny inputs share the same utils functions. Therefore, introducing modules is necessary.
