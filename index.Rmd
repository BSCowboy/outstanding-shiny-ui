# Prerequisites {-}

- Be familiar with [Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org), the concept of modules
- Basic knowledge in HTML and JavaScript is a plus but not mandatory.

## Disclaimer {-}

This book is not an HTML/Javascript/CSS course! It provides a _survival kit_ to be able to customize Shiny. I am sure however that readers will want to explore more about these topics.

## Is this book for me? {-}

You should read this book if you answer yes to at least 2 of the following questions:

  - Do you want to know how to develop outstanding shiny apps?
  - Have you ever wondered how to develop new input widgets?
