# Prerequisites

- Be familiar with [Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org), the concept of modules
- Basic knowledge in HTML and JavaScript is a plus but not mandatory.

# Disclaimer

This book is not an HTML/Javascript/CSS course! It provides a _survival kit_ to be able to customize Shiny. I am sure however that readers will want to explore more about these topics.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
