# HTML {#survival-kit-html}
In the following, we will give a short introduction to the HTML language. First of all, let's do the following experience:

  - Open your RStudio IDE
  - Load shiny with `library(shiny)`
  - Execute `p("Hello World")` and notice the output format
  - This is an HTML tag!

## HTML Basics
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is derived from the SGML (Standard Generalized markup Language). An HTML file contains tags that can be divided into 2 catagories:

  - paired-tags
  - closing-tags

```html
<!-- /* paired-tags */ -->
<p></p>
<div></div>

<!-- /* self-closing tags */ -->
<iframe/>
<img/>
<input/>
<br/>
```

## Tag attributes
All tags above don't have any attributes. Yet HTML allows to set attributes inside each tag. There exist a large range of attributes and we will only see 2 of them for now:

  - class: may be shared between multiple tags
  - id: each must be unique
  
```html
<div class="awesome-item" id="myitem"></div>
<!-- /* the class awesome-item may be applied to multiple tags */ -->
<span class="awesome-item"></span>
```

Both attributes are widely used by CSS and JavaScript (we will discover in the following chapter the jQuery selectors) to apply custom style to a web page. While class may apply to multiple elements, id is restricted to only one item.


## HTML page: skeleton
An HTML page is a collection of tags which will be interpreted by the web browser step by step. The simplest HTML page may be defined as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  <!-- /* head content here */ -->
  </head>
  <body>
  <!-- /* body content here */ -->
  </body>
</html>
```

  - `<html>` is the may wrapper
  - `<head>` and `<body>` are the 2 main children
  
`<head>` contains dependencies like styles and JavaScript files (but not only), `<body>` contains the page content. We will see later that JavaScript files are often added just before the end of the `<body>`.
  
Let's write the famous Hello World in html:
  
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  <!-- head content here -->
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>Hello World</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In order to preview this page in a web browser, you need to save the above snippet to a script `hello-world.html` and double-click on it. It will open with you default web browser.


## About the DOM
The DOM stands for "Document Object Model", is a convenient representation of the html document. There actually exists multiple DOM types, namely DOM-XML and DOM-HTML but we will only focus on the later (in the following DOM is DOM-HTML).
If we consider the last example (Hello World), the associated DOM tree may be inspected in Figure \@ref(fig:html-dom).

### Visualizing the DOM: the HTML inspector
Below, we introduce a tool that we is going to be a valuable ally during our ambitious quest to beautiful shiny user interfaces. In this chapter, we restrict the description to the first panel of the HTML inspector [^inspector]. This feature is available in all web browser but we will only focus on Chrome.

   - Open the hello-world.html example in a web browser (google chrome here)
   - Right-click to open the HTML inspector (developer tools must be enabled if it is not the case)
   
The HTML inspector in a convenient tool to explore the structure of the current HTML page. On the left-hand side, the DOM tree is displayed and we clearly see that `<html>` is the first ancestor while `<head>` and `<body>` are children. `<body>` has also 1 child, that is `<p>`. We didn't mention this yet but we can preview any style associated to the selected element on the right panel 

```{r html-dom, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Inspection of the DOM in the Hello World example'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/dom.png")
```

[^inspector]: As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:html-dom), the inspector also has tools to debug JavaScript code, inspect files, run performances audit, ... We will describe some of these later in the book.
