# HTML {#survival-kit-html}
In the following, we will give a short introduction to the HTML language. First of all, let's do the following experience:

  - open your RStudio IDE
  - load shiny with `library(shiny)`
  - execute `p("Hello World")` and notice the output format
  - This is an HTML tag!

## HTML Basics
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is derived from the SGML (Standard Generalized markup Language). An HTML file contains tags that can be divided into 2 catagories:

  - paired-tags
  - closing-tags

```html
/* paired-tags */
<p></p>
<div></div>

/* self-closing tags */
<iframe/>
<img/>
<input/>
<br/>
```

## Tag attributes
All tags above don't have any attributes. Yet HTML allows to set attributes inside each tag. There exist a large range of attributes and we will only see 2 of them for now:

  - class: may be shared between multiple tags
  - id: each must be unique
  
```html
<div class="awesome-item" id="myitem"></div>
/* the class awesome-item may be applied to multiple tags */
<span class="awesome-item"></span>
```

Both attributes are widely used by CSS and JavaScript (we will discover in the following chapter the jQuery selector) to apply custom style to a web page. While class may apply to multiple elements, id is restricted to only one item.


## HTML page: skeleton
An HTML page is a collection of tags which will be interpreted by the web browser step by step. The simplest HTML page may be defined as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  /* head content here */
  </head>
  <body>
  /* body content here */
  </body>
</html>
```

  - `<html>` is the may wrapper
  - `<head>` and `<body>` are the 2 main children
  
Let's write the famous Hello World in html:
  
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  /* head content here */
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>Hello World</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
