# HTML {#survival-kit-html}
In the following, we will give a short introduction to the HTML language. First of all, let's do the following experience:

  - open your RStudio IDE
  - load shiny with `library(shiny)`
  - execute `p("Hello World")` and notice the output format
  - This is an HTML tag!

## HTML Basics
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is derived from the SGML (Standard Generalized markup Language). An HTML file contains tags that can be divided in 2 catagories:

  - paired-tags
  - closing-tags

```html
/* paired-tags */
<p></p>
<div></div>

/* self-closing tags */
<iframe/>
<img/>
<input/>
<br/>
```
