# Template selection {#custom-templates-selection}
There exists tons of HTML templates over the web. However, only a few part will be suitable for shiny, mainly because of what follows:

  * shiny is built on top of [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) (HTML, CSS and Javascript framework), meaning that changing the framework will not be trivial. However, shinymaterial and shiny.semantic are good examples that show this is possible.
  * shiny relies on [jQuery](https://jquery.com) (currently v 3.4.1 for shiny). Consequently, all templates based upon React, Vue and other Javascript framework will not be natively supported. Again, there exist some [examples](https://github.com/alandipert/react-widget-demo/blob/master/app.R) for React with shiny and more generally,
the [reactR](https://react-r.github.io/reactR/) package developed by Kent Russell and Alan Dipert from RStudio.

See [the github repository](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/tree/master/inst/www/shared) for more details about all dependencies related to the shiny package.

> Notes: As shiny depends on Bootstrap 3.4.1, we recommend the user whom is interested in experimenting with Bootstrap 4 to be consciously aware of the potential incompatibilities to be particularly careful about potential incompatibilies. See a working example here with [bs4Dash](https://github.com/RinteRface/bs4Dash).

A good source of **open source** HTML templates is [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com) and [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-themes/free).

In the next chapter, we will focus on the [tabler.io](https://preview-dev.tabler.io/layout-dark.html) dashboard template (See Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-dark)).

```{r tabler-dark, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Tabler dashboard overview'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/practice/tabler-dark.png")
