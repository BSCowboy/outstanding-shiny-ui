# Template selection {#custom-templates-selection}
There are numerous HTML __templates__ all over the web. However, few may be suitable for `{shiny}`, for reasons mentioned
in Chapter \@ref(web-dependencies):

  * `{shiny}` is built on top of [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) (HTML, CSS and Javascript framework), and changing the framework will not be a trivial endeavor. However, [shinymaterial](https://github.com/ericrayanderson/shinymaterial) and [shiny.semantic](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.semantic) are good examples that show this is possible.
  * `{shiny}` relies on [jQuery](https://jquery.com). Consequently, all templates based upon [React](https://fr.reactjs.org), [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and other Javascript framework will not be natively supported. Again, there exist some [examples](https://github.com/alandipert/react-widget-demo/blob/master/app.R) for React with `{shiny}` and more generally,
the [reactR](https://react-r.github.io/reactR/) package developed by Kent Russell and Alan Dipert. Chapter \@ref(going-further-reactR) provides a general overview.

The web provides a myriad of relevant **open source** HTML templates like [Colorlib](https://colorlib.com) and [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/bootstrap-themes/free). Many of the RinteRface packages are actually built on top of those resources. 

In the next chapter, we will focus on the pretty [tabler.io](https://preview-dev.tabler.io/layout-dark.html) dashboard template, whose overview may be seen on Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-dark)).

```{r tabler-dark, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Tabler dashboard overview', out.width='100%'}
