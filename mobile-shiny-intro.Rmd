# Introduction {#mobile-shiny-intro}
## Case study objectives
All previously mentioned templates, except framework7, are dedicated to be used on desktop. 
Even though most of them like `{bs4Dash}` work quite well on mobile platforms, 
you don't get the native look and feel that you have with mobile apps like twitter, 
as shown on Figure \@ref(fig:mobile-twitter).

```{r mobile-twitter, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Twitter design on mobile devices', out.width='50%', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mobile/mobile-twitter.png")
```

The goal of this part is to introduce you to mobile development for Shiny. We are going to
reconstruct the `{shinyMobile}` package with the help of `{charpente}` and all what we
learnt since the beginning of the book. 

## About mobile development
Mobile app development consists in developing an application for mobile devices that is
tablets, phones (Android, ipadOS). We call a native app when it is dedicated for the specified
platform. For instance, iOS applications are developed using Objective-C or swift whereas android apps are mainly developed
with Java. Those apps are faster than web apps since they exploit the full capabilities of the platform. The UI is also
more consistent, they may be installed via a store (App store, google play) and work offline. 
The main issue is the need to know multiple languages and maintain multiple code bases. 

Isn't there something between pure web apps and native apps? 

## Progressive web apps
### Introduction
Progressive web apps or ([PWA](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/)) improve classic web apps
capabilities by being able to have a full screen display, being installable, provide a launch screen,
like native apps with a consistent UI. They must obey to 3 rules:

  - Being capable: media control, file system access, ...
  - Being reliable: fast and usable offline. Transparent failures.
  - Being installable:  Standalone use, launch from user's home screen.

### What does "installable" mean?
There are several criteria to meet the installable state:

  - The app must be served over HTTPS.
  - Include a manifest: JSON file that specify app metadata like the name, short name (`short_name`), icons to use
  for user's home screen and launch screen (displayed image before the first paint), 
  the start url (`start_url`), the display mode (generally standalone),
  the splash screen background color (`background_color`)...
  - Have a registered service worker, which can cache the app content, thereby making sure to provide offline
  features.
  
Once all criteria are fulfilled, the web browser shows an installation toast to start the process.
  
### How to develop a PWA?
Nowadays, there exist tools to develop native looking apps with a common language, JavaScript. 
This is the case of [Framework7](https://framework7.io/). `{shinyMobile}` (Figure \@ref(fig:mobile-shinyMobile)) was developed with this
template. Other tools like the Google PWA compatibility [script](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/pwacompat) 
significantly reduces the pain to make your app installable on multiple platforms.
