# Define dependencies {#custom-templates-dependencies}
This is time to start our practical session. As mentionned in the previous chapter, we will focus on the tabler, a tiny Bootstrap 4 dashboard template.
Importantly, what follows is not the description of how to customize tabler but rather provide a R wrapper. Therefore we will not write SASS nore edit the core JavaScript, even though technically possible.

## Discover the project
The first step of any template adaptation consists in exploring the underlying github repository (if open source) and look for mandatory elements, like CSS/JS dependencies. You would actually proceed similarly for an HTMLWidget.

```{r tabler-github, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Github project exploration'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/practice/tabler-github.png")
```

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-github), the most important folders are:

  - dist: contains CSS and JS files as well as other libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery. In production we seek for minified files since they take less space. It is also a good moment to look at the version of each dependency that might conflict with Shiny 
  - demo is the website folder used for demonstration purpose. This is our source to explore the template capabilities in depth
  
The scss and build folder are also crucial to the package but as stated previously, customizing tabler is out of the scope of this book. It is already a significant task to adapt a template from a language to another.


## Identify mandatory dependencies
Now, among all JS/CSS resources, we need to identify the one necessary to the template. Obviously, the Bootstrap 4, jQuery, tabler.min.css and tabler.min.js are key elements, contrary to flag icons which are optional (and take a lot of space). The package size is also to consider if you plan to release the template on CRAN and respect the 5mB maximum limit. By experience, I can tell you this is quite hard to handle.
