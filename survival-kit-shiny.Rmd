# Shiny {#survival-kit-shiny}
In the 2 previous chapters, we quickly introduced HTML and JavaScript. Chapter 1 finished on an example showing how to modify an HTML page with JavaScript. Yet, in Chapter 2, we simply introduced the language without showing any link with HTML.
In this chapter we are going to see what shiny has under the hood to better understand the link between those languages. We will particularly accord a great importance to jQuery.

## Reminders about Shiny
This books assumes you are already quite advanded in Shiny but it is always good to remind what is behind this incredible API. 

Shiny allows to develop web applications by only using R. If you remember about the first experiment of Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-html), we only did 

```{r}
library(shiny)
p("Hello World")
```

to notice that the `p` function generates HTML. We will see in the next chapters other tools to build/modify/delete tags. We notice that the main difference between HTML tags and Shiny tags is the absence of closing tag for Shiny. For instance, in raw HTML, we expect `<p>` to be closed by `</p>`. In Shiny, we only call `p(...)`, where `...` may be attributes like class/id or children tags. However, this is still a bit far from web application. The simplest Shiny layout is the `fluidPage` (if you type shinyapp in the R console, it will show a predefined snippet with this default template):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  p("Hello World")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Let's run the above example and open the HTML inspector. Results are displayed on Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-deps). 

```{r shiny-deps, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny dependencies'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-deps.png")
```

We see in the head section that Shiny has 4 dependencies:

  - json2
  - jQuery 3.4.1
  - shiny (custom JavaScript and CSS)
  - Bootstrap 3.4.1 (JavaScript and CSS) + other files (html5shiv, respond)
  
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is here to provide plug and play design and interactions (tabs, navs). For instance the `fluidRow` and `column` functions of Shiny leverage the Bootstrap grid to control how elements are displayed in a page. This is convenient because it avoids to write a crazy amount of CSS/JavaScript and always reinvent the wheel. [jQuery](https://jquery.com) is a famous JavaScript library providing a user friendly interface to manipulate the DOM and is present in almost all actual websites. It is slighly easier (understand more convenient tu use) than vanilla JS, even though web developers tend to avoid it to go back to vanilla JS (Bootstrap 5, the next iteration of Bootstrap will not rely on jQuery anymore). Shiny has its own JS and CSS files (we will discuss this very soon).
