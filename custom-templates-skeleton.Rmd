# Template skeleton {#custom-templates-skeleton}
The list of all available layouts is quite impressive (horizontal, vertical, compressed, right to left, dark, ...). In the next steps, we will focus on the dark-compressed template. We leave the reader to try other templates as an exercise.

## Identify template elements
We are quite lucky since there is nothing fancy about the tabler layout. As usual, let's inspect the layout-condensed-dark.html (in the tabler /demo folder) in Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-layout-intro)

```{r tabler-layout-intro, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Tabler condensed layout'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/practice/tabler-layout-intro.png")
```

There are 2 main components:
  - the header containing the brand logo, the navigation and dropdown
  - the content containing the dashboard body (does not mean `<body>` tag!!) as well as the footer
  
This is all!
